# Hangman Game

## Description
This is a simple Hangman game developed in Python. The game includes ASCII art to represent different stages of the hangman figure as the player makes incorrect guesses. It offers both single-player and multiplayer modes. The word to guess can either be entered manually or selected randomly from a word database. The game includes fun animations for correct and incorrect guesses, adding an interactive experience to the game.

## Features
- **Hangman Stages**: ASCII art for each incorrect guess.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Allows multiple players to take turns guessing.
- **Word Database**: You can use a list of pre-defined words from a text file.
- **Animations**: Fun animations for celebrating a correct guess or showing disappointment for wrong guesses.

## How to Play
